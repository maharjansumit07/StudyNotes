# use the blow command to install Genric Java Package (.war)
# use this url to donwload the jenkins war file. https://get.jenkins.io/war-stable/2.452.2/jenkins.war

$ wget https://get.jenkins.io/war-stable/2.452.2/jenkins.war

$ ll
$ java -jar jenkins.war

# To view the java version and list out the java to choose and install. 
$ sudo apt update

$ sudo apt install -y openjdk-17-jre-headless
-- this will run but when we close it , it will close. To solve this, we have to configure on Systemd file for Jenkins. 
-- we are using vagrant, thus we configure unit file as below;

$ sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/jenkins.service
------------------------------------------------------
[Unit]
Description=Unit file to server jenkins
After=network.target

[Service]
User=vagrant
Group=vagrant
WorkingDirectory:/home/vagrant
ExecStart=/usr/bin/java -jar jenkins.war

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

---------------------------------------------------------
for Execstart  we can find out the jaa location by simply;
$ which java
/usr/bin/java
$
for user and group, we could create a new users as Jenkins and pass it here along with providing sudo access to new user created.

Now restart the jenkins server, then it should run without waiting in cli command.
