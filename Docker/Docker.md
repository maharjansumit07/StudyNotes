Docker:

Virtulization 
- technology to create isolated environments to run applications on hardware resource. 

Virtual Machines vs Containers
-- both are virtulization solutions used to create virtual environments isolated from underlying hadware.
-virtual Machines
    - runs on top of Hypervisor,  a software helps to devide physical resources into multiple virtual systems. 
    - has its own completely isolated OS inculding kernel, binaries, libraries and apps. 
- Containers    
    - runs on top os host OS and virtulizes just the os instead of physical server. 
    - shares os kernel and just included apps with their libries and dependenci-es.
